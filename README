Greed is a dice game. Play begins by rolling five dice. Scoring is as follows:
    -Each 1 is worth 100 points
    -Each 5 is worth 50 points
    -Three of a kind is worth 100 times the number showing (ex. three 6's is worth 600 points)
    -EXCEPT three 1's is worth 1,000 points
    -Four of a kind is worth double three of a kind
    -Five of a kind is worth double four of a kind
    -A run of all five dice (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) is worth 750 points
Dice can only be scored when thrown. Three 1's rolled in three seperate throws is worth 300 points, not 1,000 points.
After each throw, you must score at least one die, or else your accumulated points are forfeited and your turn ends.
Once you have reached your minimum score threshold, you can choose to collect your points and pass the dice instead of continuing to roll.
To start the game, each players' threshold is 750 points. After collecting your first points, your threshold is lowered to 250 points.
When a player collects their points and passes their dice, the following player can choose to steal their dice (if they have collected points already).
When stealing another player's dice, you start your turn with all the points they collected at the end of their turn, but only as many dice as they passed.
You must successfully roll and score at least one die to have the option to collect stolen points.
A player can choose not to steal the previous player's dice and start with 0 points and roll all five dice.
When a player accumulates enough points to end the game, each other player is given one last turn.
The highest score after all players have finished their turns is the winner.
